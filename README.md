🤖 DOCINSIGHT-AI: Contextual Question Answering from Files
DOCINSIGHT-AI is a smart, LLM-powered chatbot that helps students and researchers interact with their documents in a conversational manner. Upload your notes, books, or any academic text files (PDF, DOCX, TXT), and ask questions directly based on their content — all through a Streamlit web interface.

📚 Overview
This project combines the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Transformer models, and semantic search to build a contextual Q&A assistant. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), DOCINSIGHT-AI enables personalized academic support by answering user questions based on their uploaded study materials.

✨ Features
📄 Upload academic documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)

❓ Ask contextual questions based on uploaded files

⚡ Real-time semantic search with FAISS vector database

🧠 Powered by fine-tuned transformer models (e.g., TinyLLaMA/GPT)

🌐 Intuitive UI via Streamlit

📊 Modular, scalable, and ready for real-world educational use

🧰 Technologies Used
Python 3.8+

HuggingFace Transformers

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

Streamlit

PyPDF2, python-docx (for file handling)

SentenceTransformers / OpenAI Embeddings

Optional: TensorFlow / PyTorch for further fine-tuning

🚀 How It Works
Upload an academic document through the Streamlit interface.

Text parsing and preprocessing splits content into manageable chunks.

Vector embeddings are generated using Sentence Transformers.

FAISS performs semantic search to find contextually relevant sections.

A prompt is built and passed to an LLM (like GPT), which returns the answer.

Answer is displayed with conversation history maintained.
